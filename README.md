# Nvim config

You know how it be :D

## Showcase

![Neovim Showcase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9521063d-e23e-43a5-8de0-e726273ba648)

Setup heavily inspired from [Full Neovim Setup from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYDG3AHgYEs) (and no, it's not the Primeagen one)
Would highly recommend novices follow along with this, it helped me understand the basics of Lua, how to maintain an organized and modular nvim setup, and allow infinite extensibility down the line.
